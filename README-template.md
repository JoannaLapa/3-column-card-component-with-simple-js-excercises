## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Gulp
- SCSS
### What I learned

In this project I priced clamp() function to avoid media queries corrections. I prepared 3 simple JS functionalities continiuing complete JavaScript course with Joans Schmedtmann. I adapted them to the design prapared by frontendmentor stuff.

### Continued development

As I still learn JavaScript this is my aim on future project. As I would feel very comfortable with JS I plan to learn React or Vue framework.
